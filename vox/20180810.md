If you don't look carefully though, you might miss what it's advertising.

It's this little thing and it's called: Juul, Juul, Juul

looks more like a flash drive or computer device but it is really another kind of e-cigarette.

Since it launched in 2015 Juul has taken over about 70% of the e-cigarette retail market share.

It's now worth about 16 billion dollars. And that success is often attributed to its sleek design, but the same features that make Juul a well-engineered product also make it attractive to young people, many of whom have never smoked before and that has people worried because devices like Juul might be designed to help smokers get off cigarettes, but they're also addicting a new generation to nicotine.

So what makes this one e-cigarette so different from the rest?

Answering that question starts with what you see on the outside. Juul is an e-cigarette, but it really doesn't look like one. It looks like a tech product and it's tiny. That allows smokers to get a nicotine fix without having to worry about social stigma, but also allows young users to consume nicotine inconspicuously without having to worry about who sees them.
